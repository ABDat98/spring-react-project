//This syntax is recognized by TypeScript as a directive to include external dependencies or references.

These type definitions provide TypeScript with information about the types and interfaces available in the Vite client module, enabling better type checking and editor support for Vite-related code in your project.
//In essence, this directive ensures that your TypeScript code can utilize the types and interfaces provided by Vite, helping to improve code quality and development experience, especially in modern web development projects utilizing Vite as the build tool.
